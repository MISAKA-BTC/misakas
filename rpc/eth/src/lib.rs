//! Ethereum JSON-RPC compatibility adapter for the kaspa-pq EVM lane
//! (ADR-0020 §16). A thin HTTP JSON-RPC 2.0 front-end that translates the
//! standard `eth_*` / `net_*` / `web3_*` methods onto the node-side
//! [`EthProvider`] trait, so unmodified Ethereum tooling (Foundry, Hardhat,
//! ethers, viem, MetaMask) can talk to a MISAKA node.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately dependency-light: it links NO revm/secp. All
//! consensus reads and the read-only revm simulation behind `eth_call` /
//! `eth_estimateGas` live in the node-side `EthProvider` implementation, which
//! kaspad compiles only under its `evm` feature.
